# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description


- I wanted to test my coding skills at this early stage and see if I could build a website from scratch.
- I wanted an easy and accessible place to keep note from my prework.
- It aggregates prework notes in one easy to locate place.
- I learned a little bit of HTML CSS JavaScript and now to use Git and GitHub.
